How do you know what salary you should expect for either your current job or a job you might apply for?

A good way to go is to find salary review guides and industry reports from recruitment agencies and job listing platforms which, for the small cost of filling in a short lead collection form, provide a macro view of industry and salary trends.

The ones I regularly refer to are:

* [Talent International Salary Search](https://www.betterworldofwork.io/more-than-money/search-salaries)
* [Hays Salary Guide](https://www.hays.net.nz/salary-guide)
  * [Hays Salary Guide FY24/25](https://www.hays.com.au/documents/276732/1102429/Hays+Salary+Guide+FY24-25.pdf)
  * [Hays Salary Guide IT Edition FY23/24](https://www.hays.com.au/documents/276732/1102429/Hays+Salary+Guide+IT+Edition+FY2324.pdf)
* [Absolute IT Industry Reports](https://absoluteit.co.nz/industry-reports/)
  * [Abosolut IT Job Market & Salary Report 2024](https://absoluteit.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Absolute-IT-IT-Job-Market-Salary-Report-2024.pdf)

These are additional sites with salary information which I have not used to the same extent but may be worth looking at

* [Seek - Compare your Salary with Market Trends](https://www.seek.co.nz/career-advice/explore-salaries)
* [Hays Salary Checker](https://www.hays.net.nz/salary-guide/salary-checker)
* [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/research/NZ/)

  <!-- * For remote roles companies will often pay somewhere in between the Market Rate for the city where the role is based and the city where you will actually be doing the work from. Domestically, the rate is normally fairly flat between cities but if you land a remote role with an Australian or US based company they will sometimes offer an 'NZ rate' rate which is lower than the US/AUS Market Rates to account for foriegn exchange rates and also -->

## A note on Glassdoor

[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.nz/) is a platform for anonymously posting your salary and rating and reviewing of employer. You may be able to use some basic features without providing any of your own information but eventually you will be asked to create an account and contribute your own salary data to keep using the platform. Fair is fair I guess.

The platform is supposed to keep your personal information and posts anonymous from employers and other users of the platform but be warned that [Glassdoor may deanonymise users without their consent](https://restoreprivacy.com/employer-review-site-glassdoor-deanonymized-users-without-consent/)

Apply common sense and don't post anything you wouldn't want your mother (or your current or future employer) to read.

There's a lot more to say about Glassdoor but I'll leave that for another post.

## Some other things to consider

  * Different reports break down salary ranges and data in different ways such as the summary statistics they use or breaking down by experience level, or include different roles. For this reason it's good to cross reference several reports to get a bigger picture.

  * Reports that contain salary ranges that are not broken down by level of experience such as "Full Stack Developer 65k - $150k" normally encompass salaries for a broad range of experience from graduate to veteran. Its worthwhile seeking out supplementary sources for a breakdown of salaries by level of experience.

  * Salary ranges vary by city and country. Make sure to compare salaries for the correct area that currently are or are looking to relocate to if this data is available.

## Conclusion

So which report should you use? Which is best? None of the reports are perfect so I recommend checking at least 2 or 3 of them, even when you are not actively looking for a new job to keep your finger on the pulse of industry and salary trends.

<!-- Salary isn't the whole picture. To gain a more complete understanding of our remuneration we can think about our 'Total Compensation' which may include some or all of the following kinds of remuneration and benefits.

 * Base Salary
 * Bonuses (E.g. Performance based cash bonus on an annual basis)
 * Equity and Stocks in the company
 * Benefits (Healthcare and Insurances, Catering, Staff Discounts)
 * Leave Allowances

This still isn't the whole picture though. Now that we have a more complete understanding of total compensation we should also weigh up other factors such as company culture, location, workload and work life balance, flexible working policies.


Maybe a job pays lower but allows 

Please also keep in mind that mean/median salaries vary by country and city as well and factors like cost of living should be taken into account.

This cuts both ways.

 When comparing salaries betweens Christchurch and Auckland also consider the cost of living in Christchurch is materially cheaper and your salary goes a bit further than it would in Auckland. -->

Also condsider that information you provide may help people uniquely identify you within the company - for example if

 * You have very unique job title that you put on the platform.
 * You provide your salary to a high level of detail (e.g down to the dollar and cent amount in your contract)
 * You refer

Some caveats with glass door

 * Salaries are anonymously self reported. I am not aware of any Quality Assurance or cross checking processes done by Glass Door so accept the data for what it is. Anonymously self reported.
 * Negativity Bias - Like all reviews, people are more likely to post a review if they had a bad experience than a good experience. Keep this in mind when considering 
 * Experiences can vary wildly between different teams and departments which can result in conflicting experiences as reviews.
 * Gamed Reviews - Companies sometimes game the reviews to boost their rating by offering incentives for employees to either go an leave a positive review when they start, or to not leave a negative review when they leave.
 * Honeymoon period - people who leave positive reviews within the first 6 months of starting are likely still in their honeymoon period which may influence a more favourable outlook.

Some other cautions about using Glass Door safely and effectively.
